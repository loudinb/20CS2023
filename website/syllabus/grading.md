## Perfectly Imperfect Policy

I recognize that life is full of unexpected challenges and that everyone has their off days. It is important to me that our classroom environment and grading policies reflect understanding and support for each of you as individuals, not just as students.  With this in mind, I have implemented the following grading policy adjustments to accommodate those times when life interferes with your academic performance:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Quiz Grading:** The lowest quiz grades will be dropped when calculating your final quiz grade. This policy applies to all quizzes, including those missed entirely, whether due to absence, illness, or other personal circumstances. <br>
 
**Lab Assignment Grading:** The lowest grade from your lab assignments will be dropped when calculating your final lab assignment grade. This policy includes lab assignments that were not submitted, resulting in a score of zero. <br>

</div>

These policies are intended to support you in your learning journey, recognizing that a single performance does not define your abilities or dedication. They are also a reminder that it's okay not to be perfect all the time and that taking care of your overall well-being is crucial. Please remember, however, that consistent effort and engagement are key to your success in this course. If you find yourself struggling, I encourage you to reach out for support, whether it's academic help, counseling services, or just a chat during office hours.

## Final Letter Grades

Final letter grades for the course will be determined using your final numerical grade and the following ranges. Please note that the instructor reserves the right to modify the range for each letter grade. However, the ranges posted here provide the minimum score you must achieve in order to guarantee yourself the grade indicated.
