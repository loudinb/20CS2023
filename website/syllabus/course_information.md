**Description:** Introduction to software engineering and formal methods. General course topics include software lifecycle models, requirements analysis, specification, design, testing and maintenance. The course introduces students to formal methods, global software engineering, and ethics for software engineering. In the lab sessions, students apply concepts taught in lecture, and develop a large group project. <br>
**Delivery:** This course is a face-to-face, in-person course. This means that class will be conducted entirely via in-person class meetings that take place at the location noted. <br>
**Location and/or Access:** Clifton Court Hall 1170 <br>


## Learning Outcomes

* Comprehend the software development and support process, project planning and organization, and for both traditional and distributed projects.
* Understand how to develop specifications, design, and test code for a set of software requirements and how to measure the quality of software developed and of the development process itself.
* Use team-building skills to work with their team to plan, design, implement, test, and develop a major software project.
* Comprehend formal software engineering methods.
* Apply principles of the ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics to class work.
