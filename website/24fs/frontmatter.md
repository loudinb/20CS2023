## Attendance

Attendance will not be formally monitored; however, due to the interactive and collaborative essence of software engineering, this course is designed to encourage active participation and engagement in class sessions.

```{warning}
Please note, while attendance is not recorded, each quiz will contain questions directly related to our class discussions.  See [Quizzes](quizzes) below.
```

## Laboratory Sections

All laboratory sections will be conducted asynchronously.

## Quizzes
(quizzes)=

A minimum of 80% of the quiz content will be based on the assigned reading material. However, the remaining part of the quizzes will focus on class discussions. Regular attendance can have a positive impact on your grade, as it enhances your preparedness for the quizzes.

## Course Project

Start now, do not wait.  The course project is due at the end of the semester **but requires continuous work throughout the semester, and this work must be trackable**.

## Midterm and Final Exams

In this course, there will be no midterm or final exam. Instead, the comprehensive evaluation of your learning and understanding of Software Engineering will be through the course project.
