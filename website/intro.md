# Software Engineering

## 20EECE3093C - Spring 2024

**Instructor**: [Brian Loudin](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/loudinbk)<br>

Introduction to software engineering and formal methods. General course topics include software lifecycle models, requirements analysis, specification, design, testing and maintenance. The course introduces students to formal methods, global software engineering, and ethics for software engineering.

The class meets two times a week (Tuesday and Thursday) for lectures. Lab sections will be asynchronous.

## Software Engineering

Software engineering is frequently described as a multi-layered technology in which the development of software necessitates progressing through successive layers. Each layer is interconnected, and the successful completion of one layer is essential for moving on to the next. This layered technology is divided into four distinct parts:

**Quality Focus:** This aspect defines the continuous process improvement principles in software engineering. It ensures integrity by safeguarding software so that only authorized individuals can access data, preventing outsider access. Additionally, it emphasizes maintainability and usability.

**Process:** Serving as the foundation or base layer of software engineering, the process is crucial in binding all layers together. This enables the on-time or timely development of software. The process establishes the framework essential for the effective delivery of software engineering technology, covering all necessary activities, actions, and tasks for software development.

**Method:** In software development, the method provides answers to all "how-to" questions. It encompasses information on various tasks, including communication, requirement analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing, and support.

**Tools:** Tools in software engineering offer automated support for processes and methods. These tools are integrated, allowing information generated by one tool to be utilized by another.
