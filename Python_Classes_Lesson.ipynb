    "# Python Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to design applications and computer programs. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc., in programming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are blueprints for objects, allowing us to define both the **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) of objects in a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: Break down complex problems into manageable parts.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Create multiple instances of a class to reuse code.\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**: Hide the internal details and expose only whatâ€™s necessary.\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**: Create new classes that inherit properties/methods from existing ones.\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**: Use the same interface for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Approaches\n",
    "- **Procedural Programming**: Focuses on writing functions that operate on data.\n",
    "- **OOP**: Combines data and functions into objects that interact with each other."
