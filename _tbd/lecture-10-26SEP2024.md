# Lecture 10, Sep 26, 2024


In today's lecture, we'll explore how Python provides a well-defined structure for programming. We'll start by discussing namespaces and scope, which control the visibility of names like variables and functions within a program. Then, we'll look into techniques for organizing code into reusable modules and packages to enhance maintainability. We will look at the Python Standard Library and the Python Package Index (PyPI), a large repository of third-party packages that extend Python's capabilities. Finally, we'll cover best practices for structuring Python projects, including file organization, dependency management, and version control, to help you maintain clean and sustainable codebases.
