# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts and Relationships

| Concept | Type | Description | Key Points |
|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Association** | Structural | General relationship between two classes | - Loose coupling<br>- Objects can exist independently |
| **Dependency** | Behavioral | One class depends on another for some functionality | - Typically a parameter or local variable<br>- Can change at runtime |
| **Aggregation** | Structural | "Has-a" relationship (weak) | - Part can exist without the whole<br>- Shared ownership |
| **Composition** | Structural | "Has-a" relationship (strong) | - Part cannot exist without the whole<br>- Exclusive ownership |
| **Inheritance** | Structural | "Is-a" relationship | - Promotes code reuse<br>- Establishes class hierarchy |
| **Polymorphism** | Behavioral | Same interface, different implementations | - Allows for flexible, extensible code<br>- Includes method overriding and method overloading |
| **Encapsulation** | Design Principle | Information hiding and data protection | - Restricts direct access to object's components<br>- Improves data integrity |
| **Abstraction** | Design Principle | Simplifying complex systems | - Hides implementation details<br>- Focuses on essential features |
| **Interface** | Structural/Behavioral | Contract specifying a set of methods that a class must implement | - Defines a common behavior for unrelated classes<br>- Supports multiple inheritance in languages that don't allow it for classes |
