# Step 1: Implement Core Classes

In this step, you will implement the core classes for our Instagram-like application. These classes will be used to represent the core entities in our application: users, posts, comments, and messages.

In this step, the classes are **independent** of each other. This means that you can implement and test each class **separately** without worrying about the other classes. This approach will help you focus on one class at a time and ensure that each class works correctly before moving on to the next one.

The following references will help you with the implementation of the core classes:

- [Instance Attributes](#pa1-instance-attributes)
- [Class Attributes](#pa1-class-attributes)
- [Visibility](#pa1-visibility)
- [Instance Methods](#pa1-instance-methods)
- [Properties](#pa1-properties)
- [Class Methods](#pa1-class-methods)
- [Static Methods](#pa1-static-methods)
- [Regular Expressions](#pa1-regular-expressions)
- [ValueError](#pa1-value-error)

The implementation details for each class are provided separately in the following sections:

- [User Class](user-class.md)
- [Post Class](post-class.md)
- [Comment Class](comment-class.md)
- [Message Class](message-class.md)

Follow the instructions in each section to implement the corresponding class. Make sure to test each class thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. Once you are satisfied with the implementation of each class, you can move on to the [next step](../step-2/step-2.md).
