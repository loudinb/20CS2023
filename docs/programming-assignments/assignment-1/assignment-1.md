# Assignment 1

```{warning}
I am currently updating this assignment to improve the instructions and provide more detailed guidance. There were too many complications that I felt distracted from understanding the core implementation of OOP in Python. Please wait for a few days as I make these updates. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me.

**Instagram-like Application Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

In this assignment, you will implement an Instagram-like application using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. The application will simulate basic social media functionalities, including user creation, following, posting, and commenting. The focus will be on two core OOP principles: **encapsulation** and **composition**.

The implementation details for each class are provided separately in the following sections:

- [User Class](user-class.md)
- [Post Class](post-class.md)
- [Comment Class](comment-class.md)

Follow the instructions in each section to implement the corresponding class. Make sure to test each class thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

The following references will help you with the implementation of these classes:

- [Instance Attributes](#pa1-instance-attributes)
- [Class Attributes](#pa1-class-attributes)
- [Instance Methods](#pa1-instance-methods)
- [Properties](#pa1-properties)
- [Class Methods](#pa1-class-methods)
- [Static Methods](#pa1-static-methods)
- [Regular Expressions](#pa1-regular-expressions)
- [ValueError](#pa1-value-error)
