# Assignment 1

**Due:** Thursday, October 3, 2024 by 11:59pm

The first programming assignment requires you to complete 9 coding exercises on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. These exercises are designed to help you understand OOP basics in Python and familiarize you with the syntax and structure of Python classes and OOP methods.

The exercises will be released sequentially alongside the course material. You must complete each exercise before progressing to the next one.

For submission, you will only need to turn in the Python files for the final exercise. However, since the exercises build upon one another, you'll only be able to successfully complete the last exercise if you've finished all the previous ones.

Each exercise includes:

1. A set of instructions to guide you through completion.
2. A set of tests to verify your code's correctness.


## Exercises
