# Step 2: Enhance Core Classes

```{warning}
I am currently updating this assignment to improve the instructions and provide more detailed guidance. There were too many complications that I felt distracted from understanding the core implementation of OOP in Python. Please wait for a few days as I make these updates. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me.
```

In this step, we will enhance our Instagram-like application by adding more functionality to the existing classes. The new features will allow users to interact with each other through comments and messages, making the application more engaging and interactive.  

This update will make the functionality of one class dependent on another class. This interconnected relationship is a form of **association** in OOP, specifically **composition**, where one class contains instances of other classes to achieve more complex behavior.

The implementation details for each class are provided separately in the following sections:

1. [User Class](user-class.md)
2. [Post Class](post-class.md)
3. [Comment Class](comment-class.md)
4. [Message Class](message-class.md)

Follow the instructions in each section to implement the corresponding class. After implementing the new features for each class, make sure to test the interactions"

5. [Testing](testing.md)

Once you are satisfied with the implementation, you can move on to the [next step](step-3.md).
