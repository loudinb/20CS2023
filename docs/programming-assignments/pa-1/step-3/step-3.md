# Step 3: Final Enhancements

```{warning}
I am currently updating this assignment to improve the instructions and provide more detailed guidance. There were too many complications that I felt distracted from understanding the core implementation of OOP in Python. Please wait for a few days as I make these updates. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me.
```

In this step, we will make final enhancements to our Instagram-like application by adding more functionality to the existing classes. We will focus on refining the `User` and `Post` classes to support additional features.

The implementation details for each class are provided separately in the following sections:

1. [User Class](user-class.md)
2. [Post Class](post-class.md)

Follow the instructions in each section to implement the corresponding class. After implementing the new features for each class, make sure to test the interactions"

5. [Testing](testing.md)

Once all of your tests pass and you are satisfied with the implementation, you can consider the assignment complete. You must submit your final code implementation to Google Classroom for grading.
