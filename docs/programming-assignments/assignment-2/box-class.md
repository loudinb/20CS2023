Certainly! Here are the instructions for the Box class based on the provided solution and following the style of the example instructions:

# `Box` Class

The `Box` class represents a container for questions in the Adaptive Review System. It manages a set of questions and provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving questions based on priority.

Follow the specifications provided below to create a `Box` class in the `box.py` file.

## Attributes

| Name                | Kind     | Access Level | Type             | Description                                    |

| `_name`             | Instance | Protected    | `str`            | Name of the box                                |
| `_questions`        | Instance | Protected    | `List[Question]` | List of questions in the box                   |
| `_priority_interval`| Instance | Protected    | `timedelta`      | Time interval for prioritizing questions       |

## Methods

| `__init__`                | Instance | None                | `name: str, priority_interval: timedelta` | Initialize a new Box instance |
| `name`                    | Property | `str`               | None                 | Get the name of the box                               |
| `priority_interval`       | Property | `timedelta`         | None                 | Get the priority interval of the box                  |
| `add_question`            | Instance | None                | `question: Question` | Add a question to the box                             |
| `remove_question`         | Instance | None                | `question: Question` | Remove a question from the box                        |
| `get_next_priority_question` | Instance | `Optional[Question]` | None              | Return the next priority question if available        |
| `__len__`                 | Instance | `int`               | None                 | Return the number of questions in the box             |
| `__repr__`                | Instance | `str`               | None                 | Return a string representation of the Box object      |

### Implementation Details

**`__init__(self, name: str, priority_interval: timedelta) -> None`**
- Initialize the `Box` instance with the given `name` and `priority_interval`.
- Set the `_name` attribute to the `name` parameter.
- Initialize the `_questions` attribute as an empty list.
- Set the `_priority_interval` attribute to the `priority_interval` parameter.

**`name(self) -> str`**
- Implement this property to return the value of the `_name` attribute.

**`priority_interval(self) -> timedelta`**
- Implement this property to return the value of the `_priority_interval` attribute.

**`add_question(self, question: Question) -> None`**
- Implement this method to add a question to the box.
- Check if the question is not already in `_questions` before adding it.
- If the question is not in `_questions`, append it to the list.

**`remove_question(self, question: Question) -> None`**
- Implement this method to remove a question from the box.
- Check if the question is in `_questions` before removing it.
- If the question is in `_questions`, remove it from the list.

**`get_next_priority_question(self) -> Optional[Question]`**
- Implement this method to return the next priority question if available.
- Get the current time using `datetime.now()`.
- Iterate through the questions in `_questions`:
  - If a question's `last_asked` is `None` or if the time since it was last asked is greater than or equal to the `_priority_interval`, return that question.
- If no priority question is found, return `None`.

**`__len__(self) -> int`**
- Implement this method to return the number of questions in the box.
- Return the length of the `_questions` list.

**`__repr__(self) -> str`**
- Implement this method to return a string representation of the Box object.
- The string should include the class name, box name, and the count of questions in the box.

Remember to import the necessary modules at the beginning of your file:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List, Optional
from .qtype.question import Question
```

Here's an example of how to use the `Box` class:

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from .qtype.shortanswer import ShortAnswer

# Create a box
review_box = Box("Review Box", timedelta(minutes=5))

# Create some questions
q1 = ShortAnswer("What's the capital of France?", "Paris")
q2 = ShortAnswer("Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?", "William Shakespeare")

# Add questions to the box
review_box.add_question(q1)
review_box.add_question(q2)

print(review_box)  # Output: Box(name='Review Box', questions_count=2)

# Get the next priority question
next_question = review_box.get_next_priority_question()
if next_question:
    print(next_question.ask())
```

This example demonstrates creating a Box, adding questions to it, and retrieving the next priority question.
