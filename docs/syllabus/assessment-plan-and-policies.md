## Knowledge Checks

Knowledge Checks are brief assessments designed to track your progress in the course. After each lecture, you will complete a set of questions based on the material covered, including the assigned readings and lecture content. These assessments are intended to be completed in under 30 minutes.

Knowledge Checks are autograded, and you will know your grade immediately upon submission. You may resubmit a Knowledge Check as many times as you like until the due date.

**Knowledge Check Policies:**

- Knowledge Checks are due by 11:59 PM on the day of the lecture.
- Late submissions will not be accepted.
- The lowest five grades will be dropped, which is why late submissions are not permitted.


```{note}
Knowledge Checks will support you in completing the programming assignments as well as prepare you for exams.  Don't understimate the importance of these.

## Programming Assignments

Programming Assignments will build on the knowledge you accumulate throughout the semester. These assignments will require increasing levels of understanding and application as the course progresses.

**Programming Assignment Policies:**

   - 48 to less than 72 hours late: 20% penalty

## Exams

Exams are open book and open notes, but due to the timed nature, you won't be able to rely on your book or notes for every question. Proper preparation is essential, as you won't have time to look up everything during the exam. Students may choose to complete exams either in class or remotely; however, all exams must be completed during the scheduled time.

**Exam Policies:**

- Students are required to take examinations at the scheduled time.
- Computer issues or connectivity problems are not considered valid excuses for failing to complete an exam.
- If you have a valid reason for missing a midterm exam, please contact Professor Loudin beforehand to make prior arrangements for alternative options.
- Students who miss the midterm exam without making prior arrangements with Professor Loudin will be required to take a comprehensive exam on the regularly scheduled final exam day. This comprehensive exam will replace the missed midterm.
