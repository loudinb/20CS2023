## Academic Integrity
Ethics and integrity are core values that should guide our conduct and decisions as members of the UC community and as engineering and technology professionals.  Course assignments and tests are designed to have educational value and prepare you to be a competent and ethical professional.  Therefore, material presented by you to satisfy course requirements is expected to be result of your own original scholarly efforts, unless collaboration is explicitly allowed on a particular assignment.

University Rules, including the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/conduct/student-code-of-conduct.html) and other documented policies of the department, college, and university related to academic integrity, will be enforced. Any violation of these regulations, including acts of plagiarism or cheating, will be dealt with on an individual basis according to the severity of the misconduct, and can result in severe consequences, including potential dismissal from the college after the second offense.

## Accessibility
UC is committed to providing all students full and equal access to learning opportunities.  UC's Office of [Accessibility Resources](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/accessibility-resources.html) is the official campus office that works to arrange for reasonable accommodations for students with an identified physical, psychological, or cognitive disability (learning, ADD/ADHD, psychological, visual, hearing, physical, cognitive, medical condition, etc.).  Students are encouraged to contact the Accessibility Resources office to arrange for a confidential meeting to discuss services and accommodations.  Contact should be initiated as soon as possible to allow for adequate time for accommodations to be arranged.

UC is also committed to providing full and equal access to our electronic and information technology, including websites, electronic files, digital course content, and software/applications.  If you experience difficulty in using any of the digital content associated with this course, even with the assistance of available [Student Accessibility Resources](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/accessibility-resources/resources.html), please let your instructor know.

## Title IX
Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. Title IX also address instances of sexual violence, dating or domestic violence, and stalking. If a student discloses a Title IX issue to a faculty member, the faculty member is required to forward that information to the [Title IX Office](https://www.uc.edu/about/equity-inclusion/gender-equity/title-ix.html). The Title IX office will follow up with the student and discuss how the University can take steps to address the impact on the student and the community.  They will also inform the student of their rights and direct them to available resources.  The priority is to make sure students are safe and successful here at the University of Cincinnati.  Students are not required to talk to anyone in the Title IX Office. Students may also directly report any instance of sex or gender-based discrimination, harassment or violence to the Title IX office at 513-556-3349.  Students who wish to know more about their rights and resources on campus, they can consult the [Title IX website](https://www.uc.edu/about/equity-inclusion/gender-equity/title-ix.html) or contact the Title IX office directly at 513-556-3349.

## Counseling Services
Students have access to counseling and mental health care through the [University Health Services](https://med.uc.edu/landing-pages/university-health), which can provide both psychotherapy and psychiatric services. UC’s [Counseling & Psychological Services](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps.html) (CAPS) provides students access to professional counseling services as well as numerous options for help online, via mobile apps, group sessions, and peer-to-peer programs. CAPS conducts free virtual consultations via the "Let's Talk" program.  Students are encouraged to seek assistance for anxiety, depression, trauma/assault, adjustment to college life, interpersonal/relational difficulty, sexuality, family conflict, grief and loss, disordered eating and body image, alcohol and substance abuse, anger management, identity development and issues related to diversity, concerns associated with sexual orientation and spirituality concerns, as well as any other issues of concern.

## Inclusivity
CEAS is committed to the fundamental principles of academic freedom and human dignity.  Diversity in all forms is something we welcome, we foster, and we prize.  We believe that honest attempts to understand the perspectives of others facilitates learning, and we will strive to achieve this goal at all times.  We strongly disavow discrimination -- including harassment -- on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex or gender identity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status.  We expect that each of us will hold one another accountable for maintaining these ideals.

All are welcome and considered a valuable addition to the university community. You should consider the classroom as an inclusive and safe space to express your ideas and viewpoints. **No discrimination is accepted or tolerated.** It is the goal for you to be successful and to thrive to your highest potential.
