# Lecture 10, Sep 26, 2024

Today, our primary focus will be on exception handling. We'll begin by briefly outlining the different types of errors that can occur in a program, then shift our focus to Python's mechanisms for effectively managing exceptions (runtime errors). Finally, we'll explore context managers, a powerful feature for managing resources efficiently in Python.

**Errors**: Types of errorsâ€”syntax, logical, runtime; identifying and preventing errors with linters and testing.

**Exception Handling**: try/except/else/finally mechanism, catching multiple/grouped exceptions, raising exceptions, creating custom exceptions, best practices.

**Context Managers**: Purpose and benefits, `with` statement, creating custom context managers (function-based and class-based).
