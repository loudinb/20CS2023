# Lecture 6, Sep 12, 2024

In today’s lecture, we will explore how to control the flow of a program using conditional statements and loops.

Flow control refers to the programming mechanisms that determine the order in which instructions or statements are executed. It enables decision-making, looping, and branching, allowing the program to follow different execution paths based on conditions, repeat certain actions, or skip specific parts of the code. Key flow control structures include conditionals like `if-else`, loops like `for` and `while`, and control statements such as `break`, `continue`, and `return`.

Logical comparisons are essential to many flow control structures, as they provide the conditions that influence the program’s execution path. These comparisons, using operators such as `==`, `>`, or `!=`, are evaluated as either `True` or `False`, determining which actions the program will take. While not all flow control structures rely on logical comparisons (e.g., loops over sequences or unconditional statements), many use them to make dynamic decisions based on variable values or user input.

We will cover the following topics:

1. [Logical Comparisons](../topics/controlling-program-flow/logical-comparisons.ipynb): Learn about logical comparisons in Python, which are used to compare values and determine if they are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, etc.
2. [Conditional Statements](../topics/controlling-program-flow/conditional-statements.ipynb): Learn about conditional statements in Python, which allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
3. [Loops](../topics/controlling-program-flow/loops.ipynb): Learn about loops in Python, which allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
