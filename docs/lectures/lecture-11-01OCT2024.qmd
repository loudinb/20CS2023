## Agenda

Today, our primary focus will be on **exception handling**. We'll begin by briefly outlining the different types of **errors** that can occur in a program, then shift our focus to Python's mechanisms for effectively managing exceptions (runtime errors). Finally, we'll explore **context managers**, a powerful feature for managing resources efficiently in Python.
