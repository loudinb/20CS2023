## Agenda

Today's lecture is part 3 of our series on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.  We will cover advanced topics in OOP, including static methods, inheritance, and polymorphism. We will continue to implement these concepts in our Instagram-like application to demonstrate their practical applications.
