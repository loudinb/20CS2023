## Agenda

Today we will explore how to control the flow of a program using conditional statements and loops.

::: {.smaller}
- Logical comparisons, using operators like `==`, `>`, and `!=`, provide conditions that guide execution. While some flow controls are unconditional, many use these comparisons to make decisions based on variable values or user input.
- Flow control determines the order in which program instructions are executed, enabling decision-making, looping, and branching. Key structures include conditionals (`if-else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and control statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`).
