# Lecture 9, Sep 24, 2024


Today's lecture is part 3 of our series on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.  We will cover advanced topics in OOP, including abstraction, special methods, operator overloading, the life cycle of objects, and more. These concepts are essential for building complex software systems and understanding the principles of OOP.
