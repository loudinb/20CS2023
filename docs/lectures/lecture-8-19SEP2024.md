# Lecture 8, Sep 19, 2024


Today's lecture is part 2 of our series on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. We will continue our exploration of OOP concepts, focusing on inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how classes can be organized and extended in Python.
