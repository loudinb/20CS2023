# Lecture 5, Sep 10, 2024

```{admonition} Announcements
- Knowledge Check 2 is due by 11:59 PM today (Tuesday, September 10, 2024).
- Related to our dicussion on hash tables, please see [Dictionary Performance: Additional Explanation](../topics/dictionaries/dictionary-performance-additional-explanation.md) for further details on the performance of dictionaries in Python
```

In today's lecture, we will complete our hands-on practice with **dictionaries** and **sets**, wrapping up our discussions on Python's basic types and data structures. Next, weâ€™ll dive into **defining our own functions**, marking the beginning of our journey into writing reusable code in Python.

1. [Dictionaries: Hands-On Practice](../topics/dictionaries/dictionaries-hands-on.ipynb): Practice creating and working with dictionaries in Python.
2. [Sets: Hands-On Practice](../topics/sets/sets-hands-on.ipynb): Practice creating and working with sets in Python.
3. [Functions](../topics/functions/functions.ipynb): Learn about functions, which are first-class objects in Python. This means they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables, making them versatile building blocks for reusable code.
