# Lecture 1 - Welcome!

Welcome to Python Programming (CS2023). This document outlines our plan for the first day and provides important information to get you started.

## Course Syllabus Review

### Schedule

Our course will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 PM to 4:50 PM. While the full [schedule](../syllabus/24fs/24fs.ipynb) is published on the course website, here's a broad overview of our 15-week semester:

- Weeks 1-4: Python basics and writing quality code
- Weeks 5-6: The Python ecosystem, writing and distributing code
- Week 7: Midterm
- Weeks 8-12: Data structures and scientific computing
- Weeks 13-15: Applications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning


```{note}
The schedule is subject to change based on our progress.
```

### Insructor Support and Availability

Your success is our top priority. If you need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. For quick access to contact information and office hours, please refer to the [instructor information](../syllabus/instructor-information.md) section in the course syllabus.

- **Email:** I check my emails frequently, including evenings and weekends. You can expect a response within 24 hours in most cases.
- **Cell Phone:** For urgent matters, or if you haven't received an email response within 24 hours, feel free to use my cell phone number. 

```{admonition} Prioritization
- **Engaged Students:** Students who consistently attend classes, participate actively, complete assignments on time, and seek help proactively will receive priority in terms of support and assistance.

- **Less Engaged Students:** Those who frequently miss classes, consistently submit work late, or do not participate actively may find that their requests for help are given lower priority, especially when more engaged students need assistance.
```


### Assessment Plan and Grading

Your performance will be evaluated through:

- Weekly knowledge checks (30%)
- Programming assignments (35%)
- Midterm and Final Exam (35%)

Let's review the [assessment plan and policies](../syllabus/assessment-plan-and-policies.md) along with the [grading policy](../syllabus/grading-policy.md).


## Class Enrollment Composition

Let's briefly look at the composition of enrolled students and discuss potential misalignments between the actual composition of enrolled students and the intended target audience for the course.

> Maybe some Python code would be appropriate here?  **Indeed it would!**  

Let's look at some Python code in an interactive [notebook](../topics/day1/class-profile.ipynb) to see what the composition of the class looks like, and potentially give you a first look at some common Python analysis libraries and techniques.


## Textbook

Our primary textbook will be available through O'Reilly Media. Let's take 5 minutes to make sure that everyone can access the book through UC's institutional access.

1. Review the [O'Reilly Access FAQ](../faq/oreilly/oreilly_access.md) and follow the instructions to create an account with your UC email address.
2. Verify you can access [Scientific Computing with Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/scientific-computing-with/9781838822323/).

Physical books are also available for puchase online (e.g., Amazon, Barnes and Noble, etc.)

## GitHub Setup

GitHub will be crucial for our course. Please complete the following steps:

1. If you don't have one, create a GitHub account at https://github.com
2. Use your school email for the account
3. Once created, visit our GitHub Classroom link: [insert GitHub Classroom link]
4. Accept the invitation to join our class organization
5. Verify you can see our course repository

We'll do a quick check to ensure everyone has access before moving on.

## Python Development Environment

We'll review several options for Python development environments. While you're free to use any environment you're comfortable with, we recommend one of the following for beginners:

1. **PyCharm Educational Edition**: A full-featured IDE with a gentler learning curve for students.
   - Download: https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=pycharm-edu

2. **Visual Studio Code with Python extension**: A lightweight, customizable editor popular among developers.
   - Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Install the Python extension from within VS Code

3. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Great for interactive learning and data analysis.
   - We'll use these through Google Colab, which requires no installation.

We'll spend some time setting up and getting familiar with these environments in class.
