1. [Python shell](../topics/python-shell/python-shell.md) - The Python shell is an interactive command-line interface that comes built-in with Python installations. It allows users to execute Python code in real-time, test ideas quickly, and explore Python's features without writing full programs. This REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment is ideal for learning, debugging, and rapid prototyping.
2. [IPython shell](../topics/ipython-shell/ipython-shell.md) - The IPython (Interactive Python) shell is an advanced, feature-rich extension of the standard Python interpreter. It enhances the Python interactive experience with powerful tools like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, command history, magic commands, and rich output display. IPython offers a more user-friendly and productive environment for both beginners and experienced developers, making it easier to explore and work with Python interactively.
3. [Jupyter Notebook](../topics/jupyter-notebooks/jupyter-notebooks.ipynb) - upyter Notebooks are web-based interactive computing environments that enable users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Supporting multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in data science, scientific computing, and education. They allow for step-by-step execution of code cells, inline data visualization, and seamless integration of explanatory content, making them ideal for data analysis, prototyping, and creating reproducible research.
