# Lecture 2, August 29, 2024

Today's lecture covers essential Python basics. These concepts are fundamental. Pay close attention (especially those new to Python) - they're crucial for the rest of the course.

1. [Python shell](../topics/python-shell/python-shell.md): An interactive command-line interface for executing Python code in real-time, ideal for quick testing and learning.

2. [IPython shell](../topics/ipython-shell/ipython-shell.md): An enhanced Python interpreter with features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion, offering a more user-friendly interactive experience.

3. [Jupyter Notebooks](../topics/jupyter-notebooks/jupyter-notebooks.ipynb): Web-based interactive environments for creating documents with live code, visualizations, and explanatory text, popular in data science and education.

4. [Python Scripts](../topics/python-scripts/python-scripts.md): Text files containing Python code that can be executed as complete programs, allowing for more complex and reusable code structures.

5. [Basics of the Python Interpreter](../topics/python-interpreter/interpreter-basics.md): Understanding how Python code is processed and executed by the interpreter, including steps like parsing and bytecode compilation.

6. [Python Style Guides](../topics/python-style-guide/python-style-guide.md): Conventions and best practices for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code, such as PEP 8.

7. [Variables and Data Types](../topics/variables-and-basic-types.md): Understand how to create, name, and use variables to store and data in Python.

8. [Numeric Types](../topics/numerics/numeric-types.md): Understanding Python's numeric data types like integers and floats, and how to perform mathematical operations.

9. [Boolean Types](../topics/booleans/boolean-type.md): Learning about Python's boolean data type, which represents True or False values, and its use in logical operations.

10. [String Types](../topics/strings/string-type.md): Examining Python's string data type, including creation, manipulation, and common string operations.
