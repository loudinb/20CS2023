Today we will discuss object-oriented programming and how to create classes and objects in Python.  We will leverage these concepts to create an instagram like application.

- Logical comparisons, using operators like `==`, `>`, and `!=`, provide conditions that guide execution. While some flow controls are unconditional, many use these comparisons to make decisions based on variable values or user input.
- Flow control determines the order in which program instructions are executed, enabling decision-making, looping, and branching. Key structures include conditionals (`if-else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and control statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`).
