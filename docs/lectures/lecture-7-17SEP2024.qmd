## Agenda

Today's lecture is part 1 of our discussion on object-oriented programming and how to create classes and objects in Python. We will reinforce these concepts with coding sessions to implement OOP concepts in Python for an Instagram-like application.

Programming Assignment 1 will be completion of the coding sessions over the next three classes that cover object-oriented programming. An announcement will be posted on Canvas shortly.
