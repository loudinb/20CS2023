## Filters

Filters provide fine-grained control over which log records are passed from logger to handler. They can be attached to both loggers and handlers to filter based on specific criteria.

```python
import logging

class CustomFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        return record.levelno == logging.WARNING

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.addFilter(CustomFilter())

logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
```
