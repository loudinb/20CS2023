# Special Methods and Operator Overloading

## What are Special Methods?

- Methods with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`)
- Also known as "magic methods" or "dunder methods"
- Provide a way to define how objects behave in various situations
- Allow objects to interact with built-in Python operations

::: {.notes}
Special methods in Python are a powerful feature:

1. Definition: Special methods, also called magic methods or dunder (double underscore) methods, are predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes.

2. Naming Convention: They are surrounded by double underscores, e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`.

3. Purpose: These methods allow you to define how your objects behave in various situations, such as initialization, representation, comparison, and arithmetic operations.

4. Built-in Operations: They enable your objects to interact with and behave like built-in types, integrating smoothly with Python's syntax.

5. Implicit Invocation: Many special methods are called implicitly by Python when you use certain syntax or functions on your objects.

6. Customization: They provide a way to customize the behavior of your objects in a way that feels natural and Pythonic.

Understanding special methods is crucial for creating classes that integrate well with Python's built-in functions and operators, leading to more intuitive and expressive code.

## Common Special Methods

- `__init__(self, ...)`: Constructor
- `__str__(self)`: String representation for end-users
- `__repr__(self)`: String representation for developers
- `__len__(self)`: Length of the object
- `__getitem__(self, key)`: Accessing items with square brackets
- `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Setting items with square brackets

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"

    def __len__(self):
        return self.pages

book = Book("Python Basics", "John Doe", 200)
print(str(book))  # Output: Python Basics by John Doe
print(len(book))  # Output: 200
```

::: {.notes}
Let's explore some common special methods:

1. `__init__(self, ...)`:
   - The constructor method, called when creating a new instance.
   - Initializes the object's attributes.

2. `__str__(self)`:
   - Returns a string representation of the object for end-users.
   - Called by the `str()` function and `print()`.

3. `__repr__(self)`:
   - Returns a detailed string representation for developers.
   - Called by the `repr()` function and in the interactive console.

4. `__len__(self)`:
   - Defines the behavior when `len()` is called on the object.
   - Should return an integer.

5. `__getitem__(self, key)`:
   - Allows using square bracket notation to access items.
   - Enables objects to behave like sequences or mappings.

6. `__setitem__(self, key, value)`:
   - Defines behavior for assigning values using square bracket notation.

In the example:
- `__init__` sets up the book's attributes.
- `__str__` provides a readable representation of the book.
- `__len__` returns the number of pages.

These methods make the `Book` class behave more like a built-in type, allowing for intuitive interactions with `Book` objects.

## Operator Overloading

- Customizing how operators work with user-defined classes
- Implemented using special methods
- Allows objects to behave like built-in types

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(3, 4)
v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)  # Output: Vector(5, 7)
```

::: {.notes}
Operator overloading is a powerful feature in Python:

1. Definition: It allows you to define how operators behave with objects of your custom classes.

2. Implementation: Achieved through special methods that correspond to different operators.

3. Intuitive Usage: Makes it possible to use familiar operators (+, -, *, etc.) with your objects.

4. Built-in Behavior: Allows custom objects to behave similarly to built-in types.

5. In the Example:
   - `__add__` method defines how the + operator works with `Vector` objects.
   - `__str__` provides a string representation for printing.

6. Benefits:
   - More readable and intuitive code.
   - Objects can integrate seamlessly with Python's syntax.

7. Common Overloaded Operators:
   - Arithmetic: `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, etc.
   - Comparison: `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.
   - Unary operators: `__neg__`, `__pos__`, etc.

8. Caution:
   - Overload operators in a way that makes sense for your objects.
   - Maintain expected behavior (e.g., a + b should generally equal b + a for commutative operations).

Operator overloading, when used judiciously, can lead to more expressive and Pythonic code.

## Comparison Methods

- `__eq__(self, other)`: Equality (==)
- `__ne__(self, other)`: Inequality (!=)
- `__lt__(self, other)`: Less than (<)
- `__le__(self, other)`: Less than or equal (<=)
- `__gt__(self, other)`: Greater than (>)
- `__ge__(self, other)`: Greater than or equal (>=)

```python
class Temperature:
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self.celsius = celsius

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.celsius == other.celsius

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.celsius < other.celsius

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.celsius}Â°C"

t1 = Temperature(20)
t2 = Temperature(25)
print(t1 == t2)  # Output: False
print(t1 < t2)   # Output: True
```

::: {.notes}
Comparison methods allow you to define how objects of your class compare to each other:

1. Equality (`__eq__`):
   - Defines behavior for the == operator.
   - Should return True if objects are considered equal, False otherwise.

2. Inequality (`__ne__`):
   - Defines behavior for the != operator.
   - If not implemented, it's the negation of `__eq__`.

3. Less Than (`__lt__`):
   - Defines behavior for the < operator.
   - Should return True if self is considered less than other.

4. Less Than or Equal (`__le__`):
   - Defines behavior for the <= operator.

5. Greater Than (`__gt__`):
   - Defines behavior for the > operator.

6. Greater Than or Equal (`__ge__`):
   - Defines behavior for the >= operator.

In the example:
- `__eq__` compares temperatures for equality.
- `__lt__` determines if one temperature is less than another.

Benefits:
- Allows custom objects to be compared naturally.
- Enables use of comparison operators and sorting.

Best Practices:
- Implement these methods consistently (e.g., if a < b and b < c, then a < c).
- Consider using the `@total_ordering` decorator from `functools` to automatically generate ordering methods if you define `__eq__` and one other comparison method.

Implementing comparison methods allows your objects to be used in sorting operations and comparisons, making them behave more like built-in types.

## Arithmetic Methods

- `__add__(self, other)`: Addition (+)
- `__sub__(self, other)`: Subtraction (-)
- `__mul__(self, other)`: Multiplication (*)
- `__truediv__(self, other)`: True division (/)
- `__floordiv__(self, other)`: Floor division (//)
- `__mod__(self, other)`: Modulo (%)
- `__pow__(self, other)`: Exponentiation (**)

```python
class Money:
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Money(self.amount + other.amount)

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Money(self.amount - other.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"${self.amount:.2f}"

m1 = Money(10)
m2 = Money(5)
print(m1 + m2)  # Output: $15.00
print(m1 - m2)  # Output: $5.00
```

::: {.notes}
Arithmetic methods allow you to define how mathematical operations work with your objects:

1. Addition (`__add__`):
   - Defines behavior for the + operator.
   - Should return a new object representing the sum.

2. Subtraction (`__sub__`):
   - Defines behavior for the - operator.
   - Should return a new object representing the difference.

3. Multiplication (`__mul__`):
   - Defines behavior for the * operator.
   - Can be used for scaling (e.g., multiplying a vector by a scalar).

4. True Division (`__truediv__`):
   - Defines behavior for the / operator.
   - Implements "true" division (always returns a float in Python 3).

5. Floor Division (`__floordiv__`):
   - Defines behavior for the // operator.
   - Implements integer division.

6. Modulo (`__mod__`):
   - Defines behavior for the % operator.
   - Typically used for remainder operations.

7. Exponentiation (`__pow__`):
   - Defines behavior for the ** operator.
   - Used for raising an object to a power.

In the example:
- `__add__` defines addition for Money objects.
- `__sub__` defines subtraction for Money objects.

Benefits:
- Allows intuitive mathematical operations with custom objects.
- Enables creation of domain-specific numeric types.

Best Practices:
- Ensure operations make sense for your object type.
- Consider implementing right-hand versions (e.g., `__radd__`) for operations with other types.
- Maintain expected mathematical properties where appropriate (e.g., commutativity for addition).

Implementing arithmetic methods allows your objects to participate in mathematical expressions, making your code more expressive and domain-specific.

## Container Methods

- `__len__(self)`: Number of items
- `__getitem__(self, key)`: Accessing items (obj[key])
- `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Setting items (obj[key] = value)
- `__delitem__(self, key)`: Deleting items (del obj[key])
- `__iter__(self)`: Iterator for the container
- `__contains__(self, item)`: Membership test (item in obj)

```python
class SimpleList:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self._items = list(items)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._items)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self._items[index]

    def __contains__(self, item):
        return item in self._items

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._items)

sl = SimpleList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(len(sl))        # Output: 5
print(sl[2])          # Output: 3
print(3 in sl)        # Output: True
for item in sl:
    print(item, end=' ')  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

::: {.notes}
Container methods allow your objects to behave like built-in container types (lists, dictionaries, etc.):

1. `__len__(self)`:
   - Returns the number of items in the container.
   - Called by the `len()` function.

2. `__getitem__(self, key)`:
   - Defines behavior for accessing items using square bracket notation.
   - Enables indexing and slicing.

3. `__setitem__(self, key, value)`:
   - Defines behavior for assigning values using square bracket notation.
   - Allows setting values at specific indices or keys.

4. `__delitem__(self, key)`:
   - Defines behavior for deleting items using the `del` statement.

5. `__iter__(self)`:
   - Returns an iterator for the container.
   - Enables use in for loops and other iteration contexts.

6. `__contains__(self, item)`:
   - Defines behavior for the `in` operator.
   - Checks if an item is in the container.

In the example:
- `SimpleList` implements several container methods.
- It behaves similarly to a built-in list, supporting length, indexing, membership testing, and iteration.

Benefits:
- Makes custom objects behave like familiar container types.
- Enables use with built-in functions and control structures that expect containers.

Best Practices:
- Implement these methods consistently with each other.
- Consider raising appropriate exceptions (e.g., `IndexError` for out-of-range indices).
- For mutable containers, remember to implement `__setitem__` and `__delitem__`.

Implementing container methods allows your objects to be used in contexts where Python expects a container, making them more versatile and Pythonic.

## Context Manager Methods

- `__enter__(self)`: Set up and return context manager
- `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Clean up after `with` block

```python
class File:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.file.close()

with File('example.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, World!')
```

::: {.notes}
Context manager methods allow your objects to be used with the `with` statement:

1. `__enter__(self)`:
   - Called when entering the `with` block.
   - Sets up the context and returns an object to work with in the `with` block.

2. `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`:
   - Called when exiting the `with` block (even if an exception occurs).
   - Handles cleanup operations.
   - Can handle exceptions that occurred in the `with` block.

In the example:
- `File` class implements a context manager for file operations.
- `__enter__` opens the file and returns the file object.
- `__exit__` ensures the file is closed when leaving the `with` block.

Benefits:
- Ensures proper setup and cleanup of resources.
- Simplifies exception handling and resource management.
- Makes code cleaner and more readable.

Best Practices:
- Use context managers for managing resources that need cleanup (files, network connections, locks, etc.).
- In `__exit__`, handle or propagate exceptions appropriately.
- Return `True` from `__exit__` to suppress exceptions, or `False`/`None` to propagate them.

Context managers are powerful for resource management and creating clean, readable code that properly handles setup and teardown operations.

## Attribute Access Methods

- `__getattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute is not found
- `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Called when an attribute is set
- `__delattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute is deleted
- `__getattribute__(self, name)`: Called for every attribute access

```python
class SafeDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return self._data.get(name, None)

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name == '_data':
            super().__setattr__(name, value)
        else:
            self._data[name] = value

sd = SafeDict()
sd.x = 10
print(sd.x)   # Output: 10
print(sd.y)   # Output: None
```

::: {.notes}
Attribute access methods allow you to customize how attributes are accessed, set, and deleted:

1. `__getattr__(self, name)`:
   - Called when an attribute is not found through normal lookup.
   - Allows for dynamic attribute creation or default values.

2. `__setattr__(self, name, value)`:
   - Called whenever an attribute is set.
   - Can be used to validate or transform attribute values.

3. `__delattr__(self, name)`:
   - Called when an attribute is deleted using the `del` statement.
   - Can be used to implement custom deletion behavior.

4. `__getattribute__(self, name)`:
   - Called for every attribute access, even before `__getattr__`.
   - Use with caution as it's easy to create infinite recursion.

In the example:
- `SafeDict` uses `__getattr__` to return `None` for non-existent attributes.
- `__setattr__` is used to store attributes in an internal dictionary.

Benefits:
- Enables creation of objects with dynamic attributes.
- Allows for attribute validation or transformation.
- Can implement computed or virtual attributes.

Best Practices:
- Use `__getattr__` for fallback behavior when attributes are not found.
- Be careful with `__getattribute__` to avoid infinite recursion.
- In `__setattr__`, remember to use `super().__setattr__` for setting the object's own attributes.

These methods provide powerful ways to control attribute access and implement advanced behaviors in your classes.
:::


## Callable Objects

- `__call__(self, ...)`: Makes an object callable like a function

```python
class Adder:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.n + x

add_5 = Adder(5)
print(add_5(10))  # Output: 15
```

::: {.notes}
The `__call__` method allows objects to be called like functions:

1. Purpose:
   - Makes an object callable, i.e., it can be used with parentheses like a function.
   - Allows objects to behave like functions while maintaining state.

2. Implementation:
   - Define `__call__(self, ...)` in your class.
   - The method can take any number of arguments.

3. In the Example:
   - `Adder` instances become callable objects that add a fixed number.
   - `add_5` is an object, but can be used like a function.

4. Use Cases:
   - Creating function-like objects with internal state.
   - Implementing simple function factories.
   - Creating objects that can be both data containers and operations.

5. Benefits:
   - Combines the flexibility of objects with the simplicity of function calls.
   - Useful for creating callable instances in functional programming patterns.

6. Best Practices:
   - Use when you need a function-like object that maintains state.
   - Ensure the behavior is intuitive given the object's purpose.
   - Document the expected arguments and return value clearly.

The `__call__` method is a powerful tool for creating flexible, stateful callable objects, blending object-oriented and functional programming styles.

## Best Practices for Special Methods

- Implement special methods consistently
- Use special methods to make your objects behave like built-in types
- Be cautious with `__getattribute__` and `__setattr__` to avoid recursion
- Document the behavior of your special methods
- Use operator overloading judiciously and intuitively

::: {.notes}
Following best practices ensures effective use of special methods and operator overloading:

1. Consistency:
   - Implement related special methods together (e.g., if you define `__eq__`, consider `__ne__` as well).
   - Ensure behavior is consistent across different methods.

2. Intuitive Behavior:
   - Overload operators in a way that makes sense for your objects.
   - Maintain expected behavior (e.g., `a + b` should generally equal `b + a` for commutative operations).

3. Built-in Type Behavior:
   - Use special methods to make your objects behave similarly to built-in types when appropriate.
   - This makes your objects more intuitive to use for other Python programmers.

4. Caution with Attribute Access:
   - Be careful with `__getattribute__` and `__setattr__` to avoid infinite recursion.
   - Use `super()` calls or object.__getattribute__() when necessary.

5. Documentation:
   - Clearly document the behavior of your special methods.
   - Explain any non-obvious implementations or side effects.

6. Judicious Use:
   - Don't overuse operator overloading. Use it only when it provides clear benefits.
   - Avoid surprising or non-intuitive implementations.

7. Performance Considerations:
   - Be aware that some special methods (like `__getattr__`) can impact performance if overused.

8. Type Checking:
   - In methods like `__add__`, consider type checking to ensure operations are valid.

9. Return NotImplemented:
   - For binary operations, return `NotImplemented` if the operation isn't supported for the given types.

10. Testing:
    - Thoroughly test special methods to ensure they behave correctly in various scenarios.

Following these practices leads to more maintainable, understandable, and robust use of special methods and operator overloading in Python.
