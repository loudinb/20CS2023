    "## Why Use Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp the importance of classes, let's consider a real-world scenario: tracking information about users.  Imagine you need to keep track of 100 users, each with various attributes like username, bio, and number of posts. Using a simple list or dictionary might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users = [  # username, bio, number_of_posts\n",
    "    [\"john_doe\", \"Nature lover and photographer\", 150],\n",
    "    [\"jane_doe\", \"Travel enthusiast and blogger\", 230],\n",
    "    # ... other users with different usernames, bios, and post counts\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of clarity**: It's not immediately clear what each element represents.\n",
    "2. **Difficulty in adding new attributes**: Adding a new attribute (e.g., bio) requires modifying every entry.\n",
    "3. **Prone to errors**: It's easy to mix up the order of attributes or insert incorrect data types.\n",
    "4. **Limited functionality**: You can't easily attach behaviors (methods) to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A class solves these problems by creating a custom data structure that bundles related data and functions together."

    "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. A class body contains attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",

    "### User Class Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why classes are useful, let’s revisit the earlier example of tracking information about users. Suppose you want to keep track of various users, each with attributes like username and number_of_posts. You could try using a list, where the first element represents the user’s username and the second element represents its number_of_posts. But what happens if you have 100 users? How would you reliably know which element in the list represents which attribute? What if you wanted to add additional properties, like bio or followers_count? Using lists in this way becomes confusing and disorganized. This is where classes come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class allows you to define a user-defined data structure, grouping data (called attributes) and functions (called methods) together. It acts like a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what a simple `User` class might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Class Variable (shared by all instances)\n",
    "    platform = 'Instagram'      \n",
    "        \n",
    "    # The init method or constructor  \n",
    "    def __init__(self, username):  \n",
    "        # Instance Variable specific to each instance  \n",
    "        self.username = username              \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Method to set an instance variable   \n",
    "    def set_bio(self, bio):  \n",
    "        self.bio = bio  # Instance variable\n",
    "    \n",

    "## What are Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class serves as a blueprint, while an **object** is an instance of that class, representing a specific realization of the blueprint. It’s no longer just an abstract concept; it’s something concrete. For example, a class could describe a user in general terms, while an object would be a specific user, such as a bulluser that is seven years old. You can create many different instances (objects) from the same class, each representing a unique user. Without the class as a guide, you wouldn’t know what attributes (like username and number_of_posts) are needed to describe a user. An **object** is, therefore, an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State**: Represented by the attributes of the object, which reflect its properties (e.g., a user's username or number_of_posts).\n",
    "- **Behavior**: Represented by the methods of the object, defining how it can interact or respond to other objects (e.g., a user create_posting).\n",
    "- **Identity**: A unique identifier for the object, which distinguishes it from other objects and allows it to interact with them."

    "### Creating Objects (Instantiation)\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is created from a class, we say the class has been **instantiated**. All instances of a class share the same behavior and attributes defined by the class, but each instance has its own unique set of attribute values (state).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance variables** are used to hold data unique to each object. These are typically defined within the constructor (`__init__`) or methods using `self`.\n",
    "- **Class variables**, on the other hand, are shared across all instances of the class. These are defined directly within the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object in Python, you use the constructor of the class, which is the `__init__` method. This method is automatically called when an object is instantiated. The object that is created is referred to as an **instance** of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    # Class variable shared by all instances\n",
    "    platform = 'Instagram'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Constructor (init method) to initialize instance variables\n",
    "    def __init__(self, username, number_of_posts):\n",
    "        self.username = username  # Instance variable unique to each object\n",
    "        self.number_of_posts = number_of_posts\n",

    "# Creating instances (objects) of the User class\n",

    "\n",
    "print(user1.username)  # Output: jane_doe\n",
    "print(user2.number_of_posts)    # Output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `user1` and `user2` are both objects (instances) of the `User` class, each with their own unique `username` and `number_of_posts` attributes, but they share the class variable `platform` (which is set to 'user')."

    "user.set_bio('Enjoying nature photography!')\n",
