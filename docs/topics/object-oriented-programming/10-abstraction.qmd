# Abstraction

Abstraction focuses on **what** an object does, rather than **how** it does it.  More formally, abstraction is the process of hiding complex details from the user and exposing only the essential parts.

::: {.notes}
Like the other OOP principles, the benefits of abstraction include:

- Simplifies code readability.
- Reduces complexity.
- Enhances reusability.
- Makes code more maintainable.

## Abstraction in Python

In Python, the `abc` module is used to create abstract classes. 

- **Abstract Base Class (ABC)**: To create an abstract class, you just make it a child of the `ABC` class.
  
- **Abstract Method**: You use the `@abstractmethod` decorator to declare a method that has no body—basically, you're telling the subclasses, "...you need to fill in the blanks here."

::: {.notes}
- Abstraction in Python is implemented using the abc module
- ABC stands for Abstract Base Class
- Abstract methods must be implemented by concrete subclasses
- Abstraction helps define a common interface for related classes
:::

## Basic Syntax

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Defining an abstract class
class AbstractClassName(ABC):
    
    # Defining an abstract method
    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass
```

::: {.notes}
Creating an abstract class is like saying,  “Hey, I know what this thing should do, but I'll leave the *how* to someone else.”

- To create an abstract class, inherit from ABC
- Abstract classes can't be instantiated directly
- Use @abstractmethod decorator for methods without implementation
- The `@abstractmethod` decorator makes sure subclasses implement that method. (a formal contract)
- This setup is like giving instructions but not doing the actual work—your subclasses will have to roll up their sleeves and implement that method themselves.
- It promotes code reuse and ensures consistent method signatures

## Example: Geometric Shapes

Let's see how abstraction works with a simple example of geometric shapes.  We'll define an abstract class `Shape` with the abstract method: `area()`. Then, we'll create two concrete subclasses: `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

### Implementation {.hide}

**Abstract Class**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Concrete Subclasses**

```python
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)
```

::: {.notes}

**Abstract Class**:
- `Shape` is an abstract class.
- It contains the abstract method: `area()`.
- The `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to indicate that the method must be implemented by subclasses.

**Subclasses**:
- `Rectangle` and `Circle` are concrete subclasses of `Shape`.
- They must implement the `area()` method.
:::

### Creating Objects {.hide}

We can create instances of these concrete classes and utilize their methods:

```python
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)
circle = Circle(7)

print(f"Rectangle Area: {rectangle.area()}")  # Rectangle Area: 50
print(f"Circle Area: {circle.area()}")        # Circle Area: 153.86
```

::: {.notes}
Each shape object behaves differently based on its own implementation, but both adhere to the same abstract interface.

**Starter code:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import math

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    #TODO: Implement abstract method for perimiter
    #TODO: Implement __str__ method to print details
   
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    #TODO: implement perimeter method

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)

    #TODO: implement perimeter method
    

#TODO: Implement Triangle class

```
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
**Usage:**
```{.csh code-line-numbers="false"}
>>> from shape import Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
>>> rectangle = Rectangle(10,20)
>>> print(rectangle)
Rectangle: Area=200, Perimeter=60
>>> circle = Circle(10)
>>> print(circle)
Circle: Area=314.0, Perimeter=62.800000000000004
>>> triagle = Triangle(10,20)
>>> print(triangle)
Triangle: Area=100.0, Perimeter=35.47722557505166

## Summary

::: {.smaller-80}
**Abstraction** define common interfaces for related classes

- **Implementation**: 
  - Use `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes)
  - Abstract Base Class: Inherit from `ABC`
  - Abstract Methods: Use `@abstractmethod` decorator

- **Usage**:
  - Can't instantiate abstract classes directly
  - Concrete subclasses must implement all abstract methods

- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures consistent interface across related classes
  - Enhances code modularity and flexibility

:::

::: {.notes}
- Abstraction is a fundamental OOP concept
- ABC module provides tools for creating abstract classes
- Abstract methods have no implementation in the base class
- Subclasses are forced to provide implementations for abstract methods
- This ensures a consistent interface across related classes
- Abstraction helps in creating more modular and maintainable code
