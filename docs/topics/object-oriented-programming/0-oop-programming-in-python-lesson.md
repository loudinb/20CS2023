# OOP Programming in Python Lesson

This lesson covers the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It introduces the fundamental principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. The lesson aims to provide a structured approach to learning OOP principles and best practices, enabling students to design and implement object-oriented solutions effectively.  The topic outline arrangement aims to scaffold the learning experience, ensuring each new topic builds upon the previous ones logically.


## Topic Outline

10. **Special Methods and Operator Overloading**
    - Introduction to special methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.
    - How to overload operators
    - Benefits of using special methods in custom classes
