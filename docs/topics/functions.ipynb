    "## Function Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can take `arguments` and `return values`:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the function **say_hello** receives the argument \"name\" and prints a greeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def say_hello(name):\n",
    "...    print(f'Hello {name}')\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> say_hello('Carlos')\n",
    "# Hello Carlos\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> say_hello('Wanda')\n",
    "# Hello Wanda\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> say_hello('Rose')\n",
    "# Hello Rose\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve code readability, we should be as explicit as possible. We can achieve this in our functions by using `Keyword Arguments`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def say_hi(name, greeting):\n",
    "...    print(f\"{greeting} {name}\")\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> # without keyword arguments\n",
    ">>> say_hi('John', 'Hello')\n",
    "# Hello John\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> # with keyword arguments\n",
    ">>> say_hi(name='Anna', greeting='Hi')\n",
    "# Hi Anna\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a function using the `def` statement, you can specify what the return value should be with a `return` statement. A return statement consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `return` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value or expression that the function should return.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def sum_two_numbers(number_1, number_2):\n",
    "...    return number_1 + number_2\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> result = sum_two_numbers(7, 8)\n",
    ">>> print(result)\n",
    "# 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local and Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, a local scope can access global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code in a functionâ€™s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a global variable also named spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_variable = 'I am available everywhere'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def some_function():\n",
    "...     print(global_variable)  # because is global\n",
    "...     local_variable = \"only available within this function\"\n",
    "...     print(local_variable)\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> # the following code will throw error because\n",
    ">>> # 'local_variable' only exists inside 'some_function'\n",
    ">>> print(local_variable)\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 10, in <module>\n",
    "NameError: name 'local_variable' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The global Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, use the global statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def spam():\n",
    "...     global eggs\n",
    "...     eggs = 'spam'\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> eggs = 'global'\n",
    ">>> spam()\n",
    ">>> print(eggs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside all functions), then it is always a global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, it is a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a lambda function is a single-line, anonymous function, which can have any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression.\n",
