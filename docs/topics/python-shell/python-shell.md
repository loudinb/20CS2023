# Python Shell

The standard Python shell, also known as the Python interactive interpreter or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), is a command-line interface that comes built-in with Python installations. It allows you to interact with Python in real-time, executing Python code line by line.

## Starting the Python Shell

You can launch Python by simply typing `python` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Hello, world!

When programmers are learning a new language, they tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message "Hello, world!" This is a simple test to show whether a computer is properly set up.

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
