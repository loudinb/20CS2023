    "# IPython Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython (Interactive Python) is an advanced command shell for Python that offers enhanced features beyond the standard Python interpreter. Unlike the built-in Python shell, IPython is a separate package that needs to be installed before use. It provides a significantly more powerful and user-friendly environment for interactive computing, making it a popular choice among data scientists, researchers, and Python developers."

    "To use IPython, you need to install it first. You can easily install IPython using pip, Python's package installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Using pip (Python Package Installer)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily install IPython using pip, which is the default package installer for Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install ipython\n",
    "```\n",

    "If you're using Miniconda, you can install IPython using conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install ipython\n",

    "\n",
    "Magic commands are special commands prefixed with `%` (line magics) or `%%` (cell magics). They provide quick access to various system and IPython-specific functionalities.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `%run`: Run a Python script within the IPython environment\n",
    "- `%paste`: Paste and execute code from clipboard\n",
    "- `%history`: View command history\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Debugger Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython provides powerful debugging capabilities through magic commands. Here's how you can use `%debug` and `%pdb` to debug exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `%debug`:\n",
    "\n",
    "With `%debug`, you can enter the debugger after an exception has occurred.  When in the debugger, you can use various commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `p` or `print`: Print the value of an expression\n",
    "- `n` or `next`: Execute the next line\n",
    "- `s` or `step`: Step into a function call\n",
    "- `c` or `continue`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint\n",
    "- `q` or `quit`: Quit the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: def divide(a, b):\n",
    "   ...:     return a / b\n",
    "   ...: \n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: divide(10, 0)\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: %debug\n",
    "> <ipython-input-1-4aaf9b4a8054>(2)divide()\n",
    "      1 def divide(a, b):\n",
    "----> 2     return a / b\n",
    "      3 \n",
    "\n",
    "ipdb> p a  # 'p' is a command meaning 'print'. This prints the value of 'a'\n",
    "10\n",
    "ipdb> p b  # This prints the value of 'b'\n",
    "0\n",
    "ipdb> p a + b  # You can also print expressions\n",
    "10\n",
    "ipdb> n  # 'n' means 'next', it will execute the next line\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "ipdb> q  # 'q' means 'quit', it exits the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- We use `p a` to print the value of `a`, not because `p` is a variable, but because `p` is the debugger command for \"print\".\n",
    "- Similarly, `q` is used to quit the debugger, not because it's a variable, but because it's the command for \"quit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `%pdb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "With `%pdb`, you can set IPython to automatically enter the debugger when an exception occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [4]: %pdb on\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: divide(10, 0)\n",
    "Automatic pdb calling has been turned ON\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-5-6528ad3c0aa6> in <module>\n",
    "----> 1 divide(10, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "<ipython-input-1-4aaf9b4a8054> in divide(a, b)\n",
    "      1 def divide(a, b):\n",
    "----> 2     return a / b\n",
    "      3 \n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "> <ipython-input-1-4aaf9b4a8054>(2)divide()\n",
    "      1 def divide(a, b):\n",
    "----> 2     return a / b\n",
    "      3 \n",
    "\n",
    "ipdb> p a\n",
    "10\n",
    "ipdb> p b\n",
    "0\n",
    "ipdb> q\n",
    "\n",
    "In [6]: %pdb off\n",
    "\n",
    "In [7]: \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we turn on automatic debugging with `%pdb on`. When the exception occurs, we're immediately dropped into the debugger. After inspecting variables, we quit the debugger and turn off automatic debugging with `%pdb off`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These debugging tools are invaluable for interactive troubleshooting, allowing you to inspect the state of your program at the point where an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration and Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython is highly configurable. You can create custom startup scripts, configure color schemes, and set up your own magic commands.  Refer to the official IPython documentation on [Configuration and customization](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/index.html)."
