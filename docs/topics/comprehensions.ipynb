    "The truth is, _List Comprehensions_ are not too complex, but they are still a bit difficult to understand at first because they look a _little_ weird. Why? Well, the order in which they are written is the **_opposite_** of what we usually see in a _For Loop_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> for n in names:\n",
    "...     print(n)\n",
    "# Charles\n",
    "# Susan\n",
    "# Patrick\n",
    "# George\n",
    "# Carol\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the same with a _List Comprehension_, we start at the very end of the _loop_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> [print(n) for n in names]\n",
    "# Charles\n",
    "# Susan\n",
    "# Patrick\n",
    "# George\n",
    "# Carol\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we inverted the order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we have what the output of the loop will be `[print(n) ...]`.\n",
    "- Then we define the variable that will store each of the items and point at the `List`, `Set` or `Dictionary` we will work on `[... for n in names]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a new List with a Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the primary use of a _List Comprehension_. Other usages may result in a hard-to-read code for you and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we create a new list from an existing collection with a _For Loop_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> new_list = []\n",
    ">>> for n in names:\n",
    "...     new_list.append(n)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(new_list)\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is how we do the same with a _List Comprehension_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> new_list = [n for n in names]\n",
    ">>> print(new_list)\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we can do this is that a _List Comprehension_ standard behavior is to return a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> [n for n in names]\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we want `new_list` to have only the names that start with `C`? With a _For Loop_, we would do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> new_list = []\n",
    ">>> for n in names:\n",
    "...     if n.startswith('C'):\n",
    "...         new_list.append(n)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(new_list)\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a _List Comprehension_, we add the if statement at its end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C')]\n",
    ">>> print(new_list)\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatting long List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we want `new_list` to have not only the names that start with a `C` but also those that end with an `e` and contain a `k`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    ">>> new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C') or n.endswith('e') or 'k' in n]\n",
    ">>> print(new_list)\n",
    "# ['Charles', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is quite messy. Fortunately, it is possible to break _Comprehensions_ in different lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [\n",
    "    n\n",
    "    for n in names\n",
    "    if n.startswith(\"C\")\n",
