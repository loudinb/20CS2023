# Modules, Packages, and Application Layout

This lesson covers the fundamental concepts of modules, packages, and project organization in Python. Modules are Python files that contain code, while packages are directories that contain multiple modules. By organizing code into modules and packages, developers can create reusable components and maintainable projects. This lesson also discusses best practices for structuring Python projects, including file organization, dependency management, and version control.

## Topic Outline

1. **Modules**

1.1 Introduction to Modules
- Definition and purpose of modules

- Hands-on exercise: Create and use a basic calculator module

1.3 Importing Modules
- Different import styles with examples:
  - `import module`
  - `from module import function`
  - `import module as alias`
- Best practices for imports

1.4 Standard Library Modules
- Overview of common standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `os`, `sys`)
- How to find and use module documentation

1.5 The `__name__` Attribute
- Explanation of `__name__` and its significance
- Common use case: `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- Example demonstrating how to use this in scripts

1.6 Module Search Path
- How Python finds modules
- Using `sys.path` to modify the search path
- Best practices for managing module locations

2. **Namespaces and Scope**

2.1 Understanding Namespaces
- Definition of namespaces
- Types of namespaces: built-in, global, and local

- When and how to use `global` and `nonlocal`
- Best practices and potential pitfalls

3. **Packages**

3.1 Introduction to Packages
- What are packages and why use them
