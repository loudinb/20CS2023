# Boolean Type

Booleans are a fundamental data type in Python, representing truth values. They can be either `True` or `False`.

## Boolean Operators

Python supports three main boolean operators:

1. `and`: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`
2. `or`: Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`
3. `not`: Negates the boolean value

Examples:
```python
print(True and False)  # False
print(True or False)   # True
print(not True)        # False
```

## Boolean Casting

You can explicitly cast values to booleans using the `bool()` function:

```python
print(bool(1))       # True
print(bool(0))       # False
print(bool(""))      # False
print(bool("text"))  # True
print(bool([]))      # False
print(bool([1, 2]))  # True
```

## Automatic Boolean Casting

Python automatically casts certain values to booleans in boolean contexts (like in an `if` statement):

- Numbers: 0 is `False`, any other number is `True`
- Strings: Empty string is `False`, any other string is `True`
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries: Empty is `False`, non-empty is `True`
- `None` is always `False`

Example:
```python
if 1:
    print("This will print")
if "":
    print("This won't print")
```

## Return Values of 'and' and 'or'

The `and` and `or` operators in Python return one of their operands, not necessarily a boolean:

- `and` returns the first falsy value, or the last value if all are truthy
- `or` returns the first truthy value, or the last value if all are falsy

Examples:
```python
print(0 and 1)   # 0
print(1 and 2)   # 2
print(0 or 1)    # 1
print("" or [])  # []
```

## Booleans and Integers

In Python, `True` and `False` are actually subclasses of `int`:

- `True` is equivalent to 1
- `False` is equivalent to 0

This means you can use booleans in arithmetic operations:

```python
print(True + True)   # 2
print(True * 5)      # 5
print(False * 10)    # 0
print(True + False)  # 1
```

However, it's generally not recommended to rely on this behavior, as it can make your code less readable and more prone to errors.
