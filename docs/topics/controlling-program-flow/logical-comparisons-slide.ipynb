    "Comparison operators in Python can be used to compare values of different data types. When comparing values of different types, Python may perform implicit type conversion (type promotion) to bring the values to a compatible type before making the comparison. For example, when comparing an integer and a float, Python will convert the integer to a float before making the comparison. However, this process is limited to certain types (e.g., numbers), and it is not full type coercion. Python does not perform automatic type promotion across incompatible types, such as strings and integers.\n",

This feature is known as \"chained comparison\" or \"comparison chaining.\" In a chained comparison, the result of one comparison is used as an operand in the next comparison.

    "Short-circuit evaluation is a technique used in programming to optimize logical expressions. In short-circuit evaluation, the evaluation of a logical expression stops as soon as the result is determined. For example, in the expression `A and B`, if `A` is `False`, the result of the expression is `False`, regardless of the value of `B`. In this case, `B` is not evaluated because the result is already known. Similarly, in the expression `A or B`, if `A` is `True`, the result of the expression is `True`, and `B` is not evaluated."
