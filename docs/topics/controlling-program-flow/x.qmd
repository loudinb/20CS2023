### Example: Iterating Over a List

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}!")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide demonstrates a simple example of iterating over a list using a `for` loop. 

Key points to emphasize:
- The list `fruits` contains three elements: `'apple'`, `'banana'`, and `'cherry'`.
- The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `fruits` list and prints a message for each one.
- During each iteration, the current value of the loop variable `fruit` is used inside the loop’s code block.

This is a basic but powerful example that showcases how you can process each item in a collection. The placeholder variable `fruit` changes with each iteration, taking on the value of the next item in the list.

Real-world use cases of this technique include processing a list of users, files, or database entries.
:::



### Using `range()` with `for` Loops

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide introduces the `range()` function, a built-in Python function frequently used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers.

Key points:
- `range(5)` creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (not including 5), and the `for` loop iterates over each number in this sequence.
- This is a common pattern when you want to execute a loop a specific number of times or work with numeric data.
- The `range()` function is especially useful when you need to loop a specific number of times, and you don't need to explicitly store or iterate over a list.

By default, `range()` starts at 0, increments by 1, and stops before the specified end number. This example prints the numbers 0 through 4, but there are variations of `range()` we’ll see in later slides that allow more customization, such as specifying a start value or step size.

Encourage the audience to think of `range()` as a flexible tool to generate sequences of numbers when working with loops.

### Tips for Effective `for` Loop Usage

1. Use descriptive variable names
2. Leverage `enumerate()` for index and value
3. Employ list comprehensions for concise operations

::: {.notes}
This slide provides tips for writing more efficient and readable `for` loops in Python.

Key points to emphasize:
1. **Use descriptive variable names**: Instead of generic names like `i`, use meaningful names that reflect what the loop is iterating over. For example, in a list of fruits, use `fruit` as the loop variable.
   
2. **Leverage `enumerate()`**: When you need both the index and the value while iterating over a list, `enumerate()` is an excellent tool. It makes the code cleaner than manually tracking an index with an additional counter.

3. **Employ list comprehensions**: For simple operations that involve creating new lists from an existing iterable, list comprehensions provide a concise and Pythonic alternative to a full `for` loop.

These tips help improve both the efficiency of your code and its readability, especially in larger projects.
:::


### Using `enumerate()` for Index and Value

```python
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide introduces the `enumerate()` function, which is useful when you need both the index and the value while looping through a list.

Key points:
- `enumerate()` allows you to retrieve both the index and the corresponding value from a list in each iteration of the `for` loop.
- The syntax `for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits)` is a clean way to avoid manually handling index variables. It returns a tuple where the first element is the index, and the second is the value.
  
This method is particularly useful when you want to track both the position and the content of each element in a list. In the example, it prints both the index and the fruit's name, which can be helpful for debugging or when the index itself is relevant to the task at hand.

This is a more Pythonic and concise way to handle indices and values compared to the traditional approach of maintaining a counter variable.
:::


### Practical Application: Filtering a List

```python
scores = [85, 92, 78, 65, 88, 72]
passing_scores = [score for score in scores if score >= 70]
print(f"Passing scores: {passing_scores}")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide introduces a practical application of list comprehensions for filtering data from a list.

Key points:
- The example shows a list comprehension that filters `scores` to create a new list, `passing_scores`, which only contains scores greater than or equal to 70.
- List comprehensions are a concise and efficient way to filter and process lists in Python. They provide a readable one-liner alternative to traditional loops.
  
This example demonstrates how you can quickly filter a list to extract only the elements that meet specific conditions. It’s a very powerful tool for data manipulation, making the code cleaner and more Pythonic compared to writing an explicit `for` loop with an `if` statement.

Encourage the audience to explore list comprehensions for tasks like filtering, mapping, and transforming data.
:::



### Practical Application: Creating a Multiplication Table

```python
def multiplication_table(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            print(f"{i * j:3}", end=" ")
        print()  # New line after each row

multiplication_table(5)
```

::: {.notes}
This slide demonstrates a practical application of nested `for` loops to create a multiplication table using the `range()` function.

Key points:
- The function `multiplication_table(n)` uses two nested `for` loops to generate a table from 1 to `n`.
- The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns, creating a grid-like structure for the table.
- The `print()` statement includes formatting to align the numbers in the table (`f"{i * j:3}"` ensures the numbers are printed with a width of 3 spaces).

Nested loops are common when dealing with multidimensional data, such as creating grids or tables. This is a practical example of how loops can automate repetitive calculations like generating a multiplication table.

Encourage the audience to think about how this technique can be applied in other scenarios, like working with matrices or grids of data.
:::


### Practical Application: Finding Indices of Specific Elements

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 9, 3]
indices_of_three = [i for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if num == 3]
print(f"Indices of 3: {indices_of_three}")  # Output: [1, 3, 6]
```

::: {.notes}
This slide shows a practical use of `enumerate()` for finding the indices of specific elements in a list.

Key points:
- The example demonstrates how to use `enumerate()` to identify all the positions of a particular value (in this case, the number 3) within the `numbers` list.
- The list comprehension `[i for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if num == 3]` efficiently collects the indices where the value 3 appears.

This is a practical way to search for specific items in a list and retrieve their positions. It’s particularly useful for tasks like searching through datasets, logs, or any collection where the position of certain elements is important.
:::



### Use Case: Parallel Iteration of Multiple Lists

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for i, (name, age) in enumerate(zip(names, ages), 1):
    print(f"Person {i}: {name} is {age} years old")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide demonstrates how to iterate over multiple lists in parallel using `enumerate()` and `zip()`.

Key points:
- `zip()` allows you to combine multiple lists and iterate over them in parallel. In this example, `names` and `ages` are paired together during each iteration.
- The `enumerate()` function is used here to add an index to each pair, starting from 1.
- This pattern is useful when working with data that’s structured in multiple related lists (e.g., names and ages), and you need to process them simultaneously.

This is a practical way to handle parallel iteration, especially when you want to keep track of an index or when working with related data spread across multiple lists.
:::



### Example: Countdown Timer

```python
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(f"{countdown}...")
    countdown -= 1
print("Liftoff!")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide provides an example of a `while` loop in action with a countdown timer.

Key points:
- The loop starts with a variable `countdown` set to 5. As long as `countdown > 0`, the loop prints the current countdown value and then decrements the value by 1 in each iteration.
- Once `countdown` reaches 0, the loop ends, and the program prints "Liftoff!"

This example is a clear, simple use case of a `while` loop, showcasing how a condition can drive the repetition of a task until a specific state is reached. It also highlights the importance of updating the loop condition within the loop to ensure it eventually terminates.
:::



### Practical Application: Input Validation

```python
while True:
    age = input("Enter your age (0-120): ")
    if age.isdigit() and 0 <= int(age) <= 120:
        print(f"Your age is {age}")
        break
    print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide demonstrates a practical use of a `while` loop for input validation.

Key points:
- The loop runs indefinitely until the user provides valid input, which in this case is a number between 0 and 120.
- The loop checks if the input is a valid digit and falls within the acceptable range. If the input is valid, it breaks the loop; otherwise, it prompts the user to try again.

This is a common use case for `while` loops in real-world applications, where you need to ensure that user input meets certain criteria. The loop will continue until valid input is provided, making it a useful technique for robust error handling and validation.
:::


### Practical Application: Prime Number Checker

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(is_prime(17))  # True
print(is_prime(24))  # False
```

::: {.notes}
This slide provides a practical example of a prime number checker using a `for` loop.

Key points:
- The function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by iterating through potential divisors and returning `False` if it finds one that divides `n` evenly.
- The loop stops early when it finds a divisor, thanks to the `break` statement, which makes the function more efficient than checking all possible numbers up to `n`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, confirming that the number is prime.

This example demonstrates how loops can be used for computational tasks, such as checking conditions across a range of numbers.
:::



### Example: Multiplication Table

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(f"{i*j:3}", end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row
```

::: {.notes}
This slide provides an example of using nested loops to generate a multiplication table.

Key points:
- The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns. Together, they create a grid of numbers representing the products of `i` and `j`.
- For each iteration of the outer loop (representing one row), the inner loop iterates through all columns, printing the product of the current values of `i` and `j`.
- The `print()` statement includes formatting (`f"{i * j:3}"`) to ensure proper alignment of the numbers in the table.

This is a common use case for nested loops when working with two-dimensional data like tables or matrices. It shows how easily nested loops can be applied to perform repetitive calculations across multiple dimensions.
:::


### Practical Application: Finding Prime Pairs

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

limit = 20
for i in range(2, limit):
    for j in range(i, limit):
        if is_prime(i) and is_prime(j):
            print(f"Prime pair: {i}, {j}")
```

::: {.notes}
This slide shows a practical use of nested loops for finding prime number pairs.

Key points:
- The function `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime.
- The outer loop iterates through all numbers up to a limit, and the inner loop checks pairs of numbers within that range to see if both are prime.
- If both numbers are prime, the loop prints the prime pair.

This example demonstrates how nested loops can be used for more complex tasks like finding specific combinations of numbers, especially when paired with helper functions like `is_prime()`. Nested loops are useful in cases where you're comparing or combining items within a dataset.
:::


### Practical Application: Prime Number Generator

```python
def generate_primes(limit):
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        for x in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % x == 0:
                break
        else:
            yield n

print(list(generate_primes(20)))  # [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```

::: {.notes}
This slide demonstrates a practical use of the `for-else` loop to generate prime numbers.

Key points:
- The `generate_primes()` function iterates through numbers up to a given limit, checking if each number is prime.
- The inner loop checks divisibility and breaks if a divisor is found, meaning the number is not prime.
- If no divisor is found, the `else` block is executed, confirming the number is prime, and the number is yielded.

This example showcases how the `else` clause can simplify the logic for detecting prime numbers. The `else` block is executed only if no divisors are found, making it a clean solution for prime number generation.
