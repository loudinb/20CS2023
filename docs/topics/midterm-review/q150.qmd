### Question 151 {.question}

What Python module is often used to facilitate automated testing?

::: {.r-stack}
::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
Answer: 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
Answer: `unittest`

::: {.explanation}
The `unittest` module is a built-in Python module that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, and aggregation of tests into collections.

### Question 152 {.question}

What statement should be used to prevent an infinite `while` loop?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `stop`
- [ ] `halt`
- [ ] `break`
- [ ] `continue`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `stop`
- [ ] `halt`
- [x] `break`
- [ ] `continue`


::: {.explanation}
The `break` statement is used to exit a `while` loop prematurely, preventing it from becoming infinite.

### Question 153 {.question}

Which of the following is a correct way to iterate through a list in Python?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `for i in range(list):`
- [ ] `for i in len(list):`
- [ ] `for i in list:`
- [ ] `while i in list:`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `for i in range(list):`
- [ ] `for i in len(list):`
- [x] `for i in list:`
- [ ] `while i in list:`


::: {.explanation}
The correct syntax for iterating through each element in a list is `for i in list:` where `i` will represent each element of the list in each iteration.

### Question 154 {.question}

What is the result of the following code?

```python
text = "Python Programming"
print(text[7:])
```

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `Python`
- [ ] `Programming`
- [ ] `thon Programming`
- [ ] `Py`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `Python`
- [x] `Programming`
- [ ] `thon Programming`
- [ ] `Py`


::: {.explanation}
The slice `text[7:]` returns the substring starting from index 7 to the end, which results in `"Programming"`.
:::
:::
:::

### Question 155 {.question}

Which of the following are included in the base Python installation? (Select all that apply)

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] IPython
- [ ] Python shell
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] IPython
- [x] Python shell


::: {.explanation}
The base Python installation includes the standard Python shell but not IPython or Jupyter Notebook. These tools need to be installed separately.
:::
:::
:::

### Question 156 {.question}

Which statement expresses that a function maps elements from the domain to the range?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `f: D→R`
- [ ] `f(D,R)`
- [ ] `f: D==R`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [x] `f: D→R`
- [ ] `f(D,R)`
- [ ] `f: D==R`


::: {.explanation}
The mathematical notation `f: D→R` indicates that the function `f` maps elements from the domain `D` to the range `R`.
:::
:::
:::

### Question 157 {.question}

::: {.smaller-80}
Objects are used to represent entities with both characteristics and behaviors. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between attributes and data?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] Attributes are external variables that are passed to the object’s methods.
- [ ] Attributes are synonymous with class methods and cannot store data.
- [ ] Attributes are the data stored within the object, representing its state or characteristics.
- [ ] Attributes are the methods that operate on the object’s data.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] Attributes are external variables that are passed to the object’s methods.
- [ ] Attributes are synonymous with class methods and cannot store data.
- [x] Attributes are the data stored within the object, representing its state or characteristics.
- [ ] Attributes are the methods that operate on the object’s data.


::: {.explanation}
Attributes are data members of an object that store information about the object's state or characteristics.

### Question 158 {.question}

To indicate that a method is a class method, what is the decorator line that precedes the method definition?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `@staticmethod`
- [ ] `@property`
- [ ] `@classmethod`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `@staticmethod`
- [ ] `@property`
- [x] `@classmethod`


::: {.explanation}
The `@classmethod` decorator is used to define a class method in Python. It modifies the method to take the class itself as the first argument (`cls`).

### Question 159 {.question}

Which of the following operations will return the first character of the string `text = "hello"`?

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `text[1]`
- [ ] `text[0]`
- [ ] `text[-1]`
- [ ] `text[:1]`
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] `text[1]`
- [x] `text[0]`
- [ ] `text[-1]`
- [ ] `text[:1]`


::: {.explanation}
The expression `text[0]` returns the first character of the string `"hello"`, which is `"h"`. The slice `text[:1]` also works but includes slicing instead of direct indexing.
:::
:::
:::

### Question 160 {.question}

All methods and attributes of the parent class are inherited by the subclasses as long as they are not overridden.

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [ ] True
- [ ] False
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in .absolute .left-0 .top-0 width=100%}
- [x] True
- [ ] False


::: {.explanation}
Subclasses inherit all methods and attributes from the parent class unless they are explicitly overridden in the subclass.
