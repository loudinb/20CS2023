# shelve in Python

## What is shelve?

- **shelve**: A module in Python that allows for easy persistent storage of Python objects.
- Essentially a **dictionary** where the data is saved to a file.

## Using shelve to Store Data

- `shelve.open()` opens a persistent dictionary-like object.

```python
import shelve

# Store data in a shelve
with shelve.open("my_shelf") as db:
    db["name"] = "Alice"
    db["age"] = 25

# Retrieve data
with shelve.open("my_shelf") as db:
    print(db["name"])
    print(db["age"])
```

## Advantages of shelve

- Stores complex data types like dictionaries and lists easily.
- No need to manually serialize or deserialize data.

## Limitations of shelve

- Python-specific and not compatible across other languages.
- Requires caution when updating mutable data (changes might not persist properly).
